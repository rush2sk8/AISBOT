AISBOT
======
<p>
This is the Arduino code for the AISRobot.<p>
The basic setup is that we use the built-in SoftwareSerial class to handle the bluetooth connection and then on the Android side we basically send numbers to the robot and based on the numbers we do different operations as seen in the actual code.
